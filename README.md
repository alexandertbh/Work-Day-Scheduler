# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

This is a work-day scheduler that utilizes local storage in order to stringify an obect and then parse it back out when the site is refreshed. This is done in order to ensure that the inputs that the user gives can be pulled and used for later. The intended purpose is for the user to open the website and see the current day then input what they have to do in hourly blocks. Once the user inputs their schedule then it is stored and will re-insert itself when the page is refreshed.
